D. Play Mode

(1) Built-in Puzzles
There are 20 built-in puzzles waiting for you to be solved! These puzzles span from 5x5 to 20x20, levels sorted by
difficulty, from the easiest to the hardest.

(2) Self-created Puzzles
You may change the game mode from "Built-in Puzzles" to "Self-created Puzzles" to try out your creations! This is
the main feature of PICROSS MAKER.


E. Make Mode

Click the MAKE button in the main menu and you will be greeted by a "Puzzle Size Select" screen. Select your size
there and proceed to draw your art in the canvas using the colors provided. Please be noted that for sizes bigger
than 10x10, only 5 sets of unbroken lines of filled-in squares each row and each column is allowed due to limited
screen size. Save your masterpiece and give it a name. You can now play it in "Play Mode: Self-Created Puzzles"!


F. Edit Mode

What if you made a mistake when you create your puzzle then saved it? Good news! You can edit your previously 
created puzzles with the "Edit Mode". The interface is almost the same as the "Make Mode".


G. About Mode

This is what you are reading right now. You can learn about PICROSS the game and this programme itself in 5 minutes.
Nothing much to talk about, really. Just an ordinary help and "want-to-know-more" page.


H. Music Mode

Think the music in the game is awesome? No? C'mon, you do! Then check out this "Music Mode". You can "listen to your
heart's content", and learn the source of each piece of music! There's also a bonus piece of music that is exclusive
to this mode!


I. Credits

Yeah, I know. It's the usual moan I'm getting. But as a developer of this game, I would really appreciate it if you
take a look and learn more about the game.


J. Thank you!

It took me about two weeks or so to finish the development of this game! I hope you will find this game enjoyable.
Once again, thank you for your support! :)
