A. What is "PICROSS"?

Picross are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the
side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken lines of
filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of
four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.

B. How to solve picross (correctly)?

To solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Solvers often use a 
cross to mark cells they are certain are spaces. Cells that can be determined by logic should be filled. If guessing
is used, a single error can spread over the entire field and completely ruin the solution. The hidden picture plays 
little or no part in the solving process, as it may mislead. The picture may help find and eliminate an error.

C. Solving Techniques (for beginners)

At the beginning of the solution, a simple method can be used to determine as many boxes as possible. This method
uses conjunctions of possible places for each block of boxes. For example, in a row of ten cells with only one clue
of 9, the bound block consisting of 9 boxes could either be:

(a) 9|#|#|#|#|#|#|#|#|#| |  or
(b) 9| |#|#|#|#|#|#|#|#|#|

As a result, the block must spread through the eight centermost cells in the row.

The same of course applies when there are more clues in the row. For example, in a row of ten cells with clues of 5
and 3, the bound blocks of boxes could be

(a) 5 3|#|#|#|#|#| |#|#|#| |  ,
(b) 5 3|#|#|#|#|#| | |#|#|#|  or
(c) 5 3| |#|#|#|#|#| |#|#|#|

Thus, the overlapping 6 blocks must be filled in.
